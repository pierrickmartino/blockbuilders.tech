Codex merges this AGENTS.md into context.\n\n## How To Use With Codex\n\n- Codex CLI: run `codex` in this project. Reference an agent naturally, e.g., \"As dev, implement ...\".\n- Codex Web: open this repo and reference roles the same way; Codex reads `AGENTS.md`.\n- Commit `.bmad-core` and this `AGENTS.md` file to your repo so Codex (Web/CLI) can read full agent definitions.\n- Refresh this section after agent updates: `npx bmad-method install -f -i codex`.\n\n### Helpful Commands\n\n- List agents: `npx bmad-method list:agents`\n- Reinstall BMAD core and regenerate AGENTS.md: `npx bmad-method install -f -i codex`\n- Validate configuration: `npx bmad-method validate`\n\n## Agents\n\n### Directory\n\n| Title | ID | When To Use |\n|---|---|---|\n| UX Expert | ux-expert | Use for UI/UX design, wireframes, prototypes, front-end specifications, and user experience optimization |\n| Scrum Master | sm | Use for story creation, epic management, retrospectives in party-mode, and agile process guidance |\n| Test Architect & Quality Advisor | qa | Use for comprehensive test architecture review, quality gate decisions, and code improvement.

Codex merges this AGENTS.md into context.\n\n## How To Use With Codex\n\n- Codex CLI: run `codex` in this project. Reference an agent naturally, e.g., \"As dev, implement ...\".\n- Codex Web: open this repo and reference roles the same way; Codex reads `AGENTS.md`.\n- Commit `.bmad-core` and this `AGENTS.md` file to your repo so Codex (Web/CLI) can read full agent definitions.\n- Refresh this section after agent updates: `npx bmad-method install -f -i codex`.\n\n### Helpful Commands\n\n- List agents: `npx bmad-method list:agents`\n- Reinstall BMAD core and regenerate AGENTS.md: `npx bmad-method install -f -i codex`\n- Validate configuration: `npx bmad-method validate`\n\n## Agents\n\n### Directory\n\n| Title | ID | When To Use |\n|---|---|---|\n| UX Expert | ux-expert | Use for UI/UX design, wireframes, prototypes, front-end specifications, and user experience optimization |\n| Scrum Master | sm | Use for story creation, epic management, retrospectives in party-mode, and agile process guidance |\n| Test Architect & Quality Advisor | qa | Use for comprehensive test architecture review, quality gate decisions, and code improvement.

add guidance once commands exist)\\nFollow-up TODOs:\\n- TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): Provide original adoption date\\n-->\\n\\n# Blockbuilders Engineering Constitution\\n\\n## Core Principles\\n\\n### Principle I — Code Quality Stewardship\\n\\n- CI MUST block merges unless linting, formatting, static analysis, and type checks pass for every affected workspace.\\n- New or modified modules MUST provide typed public contracts and module-level documentation (README or docstring) before they can be consumed by another package.\\n- Architectural boundaries between `apps/*` and `packages/*` MUST remain acyclic; introduce a new dependency only with an ADR recorded in `docs/architecture/decisions/`.\\n- Code owners MUST reject pull requests that exceed cyclomatic complexity 10 or 30 executable lines per function unless the PR links a mitigation plan in the spec/plan.\\n\\n**Rationale:** Stable, well-documented modules prevent cascading regressions and keep the monorepo maintainable as more strategy tooling ships.\\n\\n### Principle II — Test-First Evidence\\n\\n- Every feature branch MUST add or update automated tests that fail before implementation and pass afterward; merging without test evidence is prohibited.\\n- Services MUST maintain ≥85% statement coverage on all files touched by the change; lower coverage requires an explicit waiver logged in `specs/.../plan.md`.\\n- Critical trading and simulation paths MUST include integration tests (API + worker + data stores) that run in CI pre-merge and nightly.\\n- The test suite MUST be deterministic; flaky tests block merges until quarantined with an issue link and remediation plan.\\n\\n**Rationale:** Evidence-driven development catches regressions early, protecting customer trust in simulations and live-trading outcomes.\\n\\n### Principle III — Consistent User Journeys\\n\\n- Front-end work MUST compose components and tokens from `packages/design-system`; introducing bespoke UI requires documented approval in the spec.\\n- All UI additions MUST pass automated accessibility checks (eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y + Lighthouse) meeting WCAG 2.1 AA for semantic structure, contrast, and keyboard flows.\\n- Feature specs MUST pin the UX reference (e.g., `docs/front-end-spec.md` version) and any deviation MUST include updated mockups reviewed by UX before development starts.\\n- Responsive breakpoints (mobile ≤640px, tablet ≤1024px, desktop >1024px) MUST be validated before release; failing breakpoints require a follow-up task before launch.\\n\\n**Rationale:** Consistent interactions and accessible visuals make the no-code lab feel trustworthy for new builders and power users alike.\\n\\n### Principle IV — Performance Guarantees\\n\\n- The Next.js app MUST sustain Largest Contentful Paint ≤2.5s at p75 on mid-tier hardware (Chrome: Moto G Power profile) before a feature can graduate from QA.\\n- FastAPI endpoints serving trade or simulation data MUST meet ≤200ms p95 latency under 500 req/min synthetic load in the staging stack.\\n- Celery/worker jobs that power backtests MUST finish a 30-day hourly dataset within 5 minutes; longer runtimes require sliced execution plans documented in the spec.\\n- Every feature plan MUST specify the metric sources (Datadog dashboards, Chrome traces, pytest perf markers) that will demonstrate budget compliance post-release.\\n\\n**Rationale:** Performance determines whether strategy iteration feels immediate or unusable; guarding budgets keeps the lab viable for realtime decision-making.\\n\\n## Implementation Guardrails\\n\\n- Instrumentation: All services MUST emit structured logs with correlation IDs, latency, and error codes; metrics and traces MUST flow to Datadog before feature launch.\\n- Secrets: Environment configuration MUST come from `.env` templates checked into the repo; hard-coded secrets or ad-hoc env vars are forbidden.\\n- Dependencies: Third-party libraries MUST undergo security vetting (license + CVE scan) recorded in the plan doc before inclusion.\\n- Documentation: Every approved ADR MUST note the principle(s) it satisfies and link back to the relevant spec/plan section.\\n\\n## Workflow & Compliance\\n\\n- Feature plans MUST document how each principle is satisfied; missing detail blocks Phase 0 research sign-off.\\n- Specs MUST enumerate test evidence (Principle II), UX references (Principle III), and performance budgets (Principle IV) before status can move past Draft.\\n- Pull requests MUST reference the governing principle for each non-trivial change in the PR description checklist.\\n- Quarterly, the engineering leads and PM review adherence metrics (lint pass rate, coverage deltas, performance budgets) and publish an audit note in `/docs/ops/`.\\n\\n## Governance\\n\\n- This constitution supersedes contradictory guidance in other docs; conflicts MUST resolve in favor of the latest amended constitution.\\n- Amendments require (1) linked discussion issue, (2) approval from Engineering Lead, Product Lead, and UX, and (3) updated Sync Impact Report plus version bump per SemVer.\\n- Ratification changes (MAJOR versions) require migration guidance for existing specs/plans; MINOR captures new principles; PATCH covers textual clarifications only.\\n- Compliance audits run quarterly; discoverable violations MUST have corrective tasks tracked in Linear within five business days.\\n- Technical decisions (ADR, plan, spec, PR) MUST cite the relevant principle(s) and record any granted waivers with an expiration date.\\n\\n**Version**: 1.1.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): Provide original adoption date | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-27\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

The product centers on a drag-and-drop canvas, trustworthy simulations, and guided learning so builders can reach their first win fast and scale into cohort-ready workflows.\\n\\n## Quick Start for Contributors\\n\\n> ⚠️ The codebase is being scaffolded (see planned structure below). These steps capture the agreed setup so you can hit the ground running as soon as the monorepo lands.\\n\\n### 1. Install Prerequisites\\n\\n```bash\\nbrew install node@20 pnpm python@3.11 poetry redis awscli pre-commit\\nbrew install --cask docker\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Bootstrap the Monorepo\\n\\n```bash\\npnpm install\\npoetry install --sync --no-root --directory apps/api\\npoetry install --sync --no-root --directory apps/workers\\ncp .env.example .env\\ncp apps/web/.env.local.example apps/web/.env.local\\npre-commit install\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Run the Stack\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker compose up redis timescale -d\\npnpm turbo run dev --parallel     # launches web, FastAPI, and Celery worker together\\n```\\n\\nUseful one-offs:\\n\\n- `pnpm --filter web dev` — frontend only\\n- `pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/api dev` — FastAPI with reload via poetry/uvicorn\\n- `pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/workers dev` — Celery worker using poetry\\n- `pnpm turbo run test` / `poetry run pytest` — JS/TS and Python tests\\n- `python scripts/mock_datadog_agent.py --port 8282` — local Datadog shim that echoes audit log payloads for instrumentation checks\\n\\nEnvironment variables are documented in `docs/architecture.md#environment-configuration`. Copy `.env.example` as above and fill in Supabase, Stripe, and AWS secrets from 1Password.\\n\\n## Planned Repository Shape\\n\\nThe monorepo will follow the architecture blueprint:\\n\\n```text\\nblockbuilders/\\n├── apps/\\n│   ├── web/                     # Next.js App Router UI\\n│   ├── api/                     # FastAPI service\\n│   └── workers/                 # Celery workloads\\n├── packages/                    # Shared types, design system, API client\\n├── infrastructure/              # Terraform & deployment manifests\\n├── scripts/                     # Local tooling and automation\\n├── turbo.json / pnpm-workspace.yaml\\n├── .env.example / docs/\\n└── ...\\n```\\n\\nCheck `docs/architecture.md#unified-project-structure` for the authoritative layout, build commands, and CI/CD flow.\\n\\n## Key Product Docs\\n\\n- [Product Requirements Document](docs/prd.md) — source of truth for scope, success metrics, and phased roadmap (v1.7).\\n- [Fullstack Architecture](docs/architecture.md) — monorepo structure, service contracts, deployment plan, and operational runbooks (v0.4).\\n- [UI/UX Specification](docs/front-end-spec.md) — personas, flows, component inventory, and visual guardrails (v0.3).\\n- [Project Brief](docs/brief.md) — market context, research timeline, and risk tracker for PM/leadership syncs.\\n- [Engineering Constitution](.specify/memory/constitution.md) - non-negotiable principles for code quality, testing, UX consistency, and performance governance (v1.1.0).\\n\\n## Collaboration Rituals\\n\\n- **PR workflow:** feature branches → PR with linked story → CI green → PM/QA sign-off → squash merge to `main`.\\n- **Status updates:** async standup in Linear each morning; beta KPI scorecard reviewed every Friday.\\n- **Research intake:** log interviews and competitive findings in the shared Notion hub within 24 hours.\\n\\nQuestions or onboarding blockers?

merging without test evidence is prohibited.\n-- Services MUST maintain ≥85% statement coverage on all files touched by the change; lower coverage requires an explicit waiver logged in `specs/.../plan.md`.\n-- Critical trading and simulation paths MUST include integration tests (API + worker + data stores) that run in CI pre-merge and nightly.\n-- The test suite MUST be deterministic; flaky tests block merges until quarantined with an issue link and remediation plan.\n-\n-**Rationale:** Evidence-driven development catches regressions early, protecting customer trust in simulations and live-trading outcomes.\n-\n-### Principle III — Consistent User Journeys\n-\n-- Front-end work MUST compose components and tokens from `packages/design-system`; introducing bespoke UI requires documented approval in the spec.\n-- All UI additions MUST pass automated accessibility checks (eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y + Lighthouse) meeting WCAG 2.1 AA for semantic structure, contrast, and keyboard flows.\n-- Feature specs MUST pin the UX reference (e.g., `docs/front-end-spec.md` version) and any deviation MUST include updated mockups reviewed by UX before development starts.\n-- Responsive breakpoints (mobile ≤640px, tablet ≤1024px, desktop >1024px) MUST be validated before release; failing breakpoints require a follow-up task before launch.\n-\n-**Rationale:** Consistent interactions and accessible visuals make the no-code lab feel trustworthy for new builders and power users alike.\n-\n-### Principle IV — Performance Guarantees\n-\n-- The Next.js app MUST sustain Largest Contentful Paint ≤2.5s at p75 on mid-tier hardware (Chrome: Moto G Power profile) before a feature can graduate from QA.\n-- FastAPI endpoints serving trade or simulation data MUST meet ≤200ms p95 latency under 500 req/min synthetic load in the staging stack.\n-- Celery/worker jobs that power backtests MUST finish a 30-day hourly dataset within 5 minutes; longer runtimes require sliced execution plans documented in the spec.\n-- Every feature plan MUST specify the metric sources (Datadog dashboards, Chrome traces, pytest perf markers) that will demonstrate budget compliance post-release.\n-\n-**Rationale:** Performance determines whether strategy iteration feels immediate or unusable; guarding budgets keeps the lab viable for realtime decision-making.\n-\n-## Implementation Guardrails\n-\n-- Instrumentation: All services MUST emit structured logs with correlation IDs, latency, and error codes; metrics and traces MUST flow to Datadog before feature launch.\n-- Secrets: Environment configuration MUST come from `.env` templates checked into the repo; hard-coded secrets or ad-hoc env vars are forbidden.\n-- Dependencies: Third-party libraries MUST undergo security vetting (license + CVE scan) recorded in the plan doc before inclusion.\n-- Documentation: Every approved ADR MUST note the principle(s) it satisfies and link back to the relevant spec/plan section.\n-\n-## Workflow & Compliance\n-\n-- Feature plans MUST document how each principle is satisfied; missing detail blocks Phase 0 research sign-off.\n-- Specs MUST enumerate test evidence (Principle II), UX references (Principle III), and performance budgets (Principle IV) before status can move past Draft.\n-- Pull requests MUST reference the governing principle for each non-trivial change in the PR description checklist.\n-- Quarterly, the engineering leads and PM review adherence metrics (lint pass rate, coverage deltas, performance budgets) and publish an audit note in `/docs/ops/`.\n-\n-## Governance\n-\n-- This constitution supersedes contradictory guidance in other docs; conflicts MUST resolve in favor of the latest amended constitution.\n-- Amendments require (1) linked discussion issue, (2) approval from Engineering Lead, Product Lead, and UX, and (3) updated Sync Impact Report plus version bump per SemVer.\n-- Ratification changes (MAJOR versions) require migration guidance for existing specs/plans; MINOR captures new principles; PATCH covers textual clarifications only.\n-- Compliance audits run quarterly; discoverable violations MUST have corrective tasks tracked in Linear within five business days.\n-- Technical decisions (ADR, plan, spec, PR) MUST cite the relevant principle(s) and record any granted waivers with an expiration date.\n-\n-**Version**: 1.1.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): Provide original adoption date | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-27\n+<!--\n+Sync Impact Report\n+Version: 1.1.0 → 1.2.0\n+Modified Principles:\n+- Principle I — Code Quality Stewardship (decision evidence made explicit)\n+- Principle II — Test-First Evidence (planning and waiver governance clarified)\n+- Principle III — Consistent User Journeys (evidence and validation tightened)\n+- Principle IV — Performance Guarantees (measurement governance clarified)\n+Added Sections:\n+- None\n+Removed Sections:\n+- None\n+Templates:\n+- .specify/templates/plan-template.md ✅ aligned (Principle Evidence heading added)\n+- .specify/templates/spec-template.md ✅ aligned (owner prompts added)\n+- .specify/templates/tasks-template.md ✅ aligned (no change required)\n+- README.md ✅ version reference updated\n+- .specify/templates/commands/ ⚠ pending (directory absent;

failing breakpoints require a follow-up task before launch.\n+- Pull requests touching UI MUST attach before/after screenshots or recordings demonstrating compliance with the pinned UX reference and accessibility results.\n+\n+**Rationale:** Consistent interactions and accessible visuals make the no-code lab feel trustworthy for new builders and power users alike.\n+\n+### Principle IV — Performance Guarantees\n+\n+Every performance budget guards the lab's responsiveness.\n+\n+- Feature plans MUST declare the performance budgets they will protect and list the measurement tooling (Datadog dashboards, Chrome traces, pytest perf markers) before implementation begins.\n+- The Next.js app MUST sustain Largest Contentful Paint ≤2.5s at p75 on mid-tier hardware (Chrome: Moto G Power profile) before a feature can graduate from QA.\n+- FastAPI endpoints serving trade or simulation data MUST meet ≤200ms p95 latency under 500 req/min synthetic load in the staging stack.\n+- Celery/worker jobs that power backtests MUST finish a 30-day hourly dataset within 5 minutes; longer runtimes require sliced execution plans documented in the spec.\n+- Performance regressions detected post-merge MUST trigger an immediate rollback or hotfix plan reviewed within one business day.\n+\n+**Rationale:** Performance determines whether strategy iteration feels immediate or unusable; guarding budgets keeps the lab viable for realtime decision-making.\n+\n+## Implementation Guardrails\n+\n+- **Decision Traceability:** All plans, ADRs, and PR templates MUST include a \"Principle Evidence\" section summarizing how the change satisfies or waives Principles I–IV and linking to supporting artifacts.\n+- **Instrumentation:** All services MUST emit structured logs with correlation IDs, latency, and error codes; metrics and traces MUST flow to Datadog before feature launch.\n+- **Secrets:** Environment configuration MUST come from `.env` templates checked into the repo; hard-coded secrets or ad-hoc env vars are forbidden.\n+- **Dependencies:** Third-party libraries MUST undergo security vetting (license + CVE scan) recorded in the plan doc before inclusion.\n+- **Documentation:** Every approved ADR MUST note the principle(s) it satisfies, link back to the relevant spec/plan section, and capture any waivers with expiration and owner.\n+\n+## Workflow & Compliance\n+\n+- Feature plans MUST map requirements to the supporting principle evidence before Phase 0 research concludes; missing detail blocks sign-off.\n+- Specs MUST enumerate test evidence (Principle II), UX references (Principle III), performance budgets (Principle IV), and name the accountable owner for each validation before status can move past Draft.\n+- Pull requests MUST reference the governing principle for each non-trivial change and link to the evidence captured in the plan, spec, or ADR.\n+- Waivers granted during review MUST be logged with owner, expiry, and mitigation path in the relevant plan or ADR before merge.\n+- Quarterly, the engineering leads and PM review adherence metrics (lint pass rate, coverage deltas, performance budgets) and publish an audit note in `/docs/ops/`.\n+\n+## Governance\n+\n+- This constitution supersedes contradictory guidance in other docs; conflicts MUST resolve in favor of the latest amended constitution.\n+- Amendments require (1) linked discussion issue, (2) approval from Engineering Lead, Product Lead, and UX, and (3) updated Sync Impact Report plus version bump per SemVer.\n+- Ratification changes (MAJOR versions) require migration guidance for existing specs/plans; MINOR captures new or materially expanded principles; PATCH covers textual clarifications only.\n+- Compliance audits run quarterly; discoverable violations MUST have corrective tasks tracked in Linear within five business days and associated waivers revoked.\n+- Technical decisions (ADR, plan, spec, PR) MUST cite the relevant principle(s), record any granted waivers with an expiration date, and escalate unresolved conflicts to the Engineering Lead before implementation proceeds.\n+\n+**Version**: 1.2.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): Provide original adoption date | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-28\n*** End Patch"}}

introduce a new dependency only with an ADR recorded in `docs/architecture/decisions/`.\\n- Code owners MUST reject pull requests that exceed cyclomatic complexity 10 or 30 executable lines per function unless the accompanying plan documents a remediation owner and deadline.\\n\\n**Rationale:** Explicit decision evidence and stable, well-documented modules prevent cascading regressions and keep the monorepo maintainable as more strategy tooling ships.\\n\\n### Principle II — Test-First Evidence\\n\\nWe prove value through automated evidence before shipping features.\\n\\n- Plans and specs MUST enumerate the unit, integration, contract, and performance tests that will fail before implementation and pass afterward for every acceptance criterion.\\n- Every feature branch MUST add or update automated tests that fail before implementation and pass afterward; merging without test evidence is prohibited.\\n- Services MUST maintain ≥85% statement coverage on all files touched by the change; lower coverage requires an explicit waiver logged in `specs/.../plan.md` with expiry and owner.\\n- Critical trading and simulation paths MUST include integration tests (API + worker + data stores) that run in CI pre-merge and nightly.\\n- The test suite MUST be deterministic; flaky tests block merges until quarantined with an issue link and remediation plan.\\n\\n**Rationale:** Evidence-driven development catches regressions early, protecting customer trust in simulations and live-trading outcomes.\\n\\n### Principle III — Consistent User Journeys\\n\\nUsers experience Blockbuilders through consistent, accessible journeys.\\n\\n- Front-end work MUST compose components and tokens from `packages/design-system`; introducing bespoke UI requires documented approval in the spec signed by UX.\\n- All UI additions MUST pass automated accessibility checks (eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y + Lighthouse) meeting WCAG 2.1 AA for semantic structure, contrast, and keyboard flows.\\n- Feature specs MUST pin the UX reference (e.g., `docs/front-end-spec.md` version) and any deviation MUST include updated mockups reviewed by UX before development starts.\\n- Responsive breakpoints (mobile ≤640px, tablet ≤1024px, desktop >1024px) MUST be validated before release; failing breakpoints require a follow-up task before launch.\\n- Pull requests touching UI MUST attach before/after screenshots or recordings demonstrating compliance with the pinned UX reference and accessibility results.\\n\\n**Rationale:** Consistent interactions and accessible visuals make the no-code lab feel trustworthy for new builders and power users alike.\\n\\n### Principle IV — Performance Guarantees\\n\\nEvery performance budget guards the lab's responsiveness.\\n\\n- Feature plans MUST declare the performance budgets they will protect and list the measurement tooling (Datadog dashboards, Chrome traces, pytest perf markers) before implementation begins.\\n- The Next.js app MUST sustain Largest Contentful Paint ≤2.5s at p75 on mid-tier hardware (Chrome: Moto G Power profile) before a feature can graduate from QA.\\n- FastAPI endpoints serving trade or simulation data MUST meet ≤200ms p95 latency under 500 req/min synthetic load in the staging stack.\\n- Celery/worker jobs that power backtests MUST finish a 30-day hourly dataset within 5 minutes; longer runtimes require sliced execution plans documented in the spec.\\n- Performance regressions detected post-merge MUST trigger an immediate rollback or hotfix plan reviewed within one business day.\\n\\n**Rationale:** Performance determines whether strategy iteration feels immediate or unusable; guarding budgets keeps the lab viable for realtime decision-making.\\n\\n## Implementation Guardrails\\n\\n- **Decision Traceability:** All plans, ADRs, and PR templates MUST include a \\\"Principle Evidence\\\" section summarizing how the change satisfies or waives Principles I–IV and linking to supporting artifacts.\\n- **Instrumentation:** All services MUST emit structured logs with correlation IDs, latency, and error codes; metrics and traces MUST flow to Datadog before feature launch.\\n- **Secrets:** Environment configuration MUST come from `.env` templates checked into the repo; hard-coded secrets or ad-hoc env vars are forbidden.\\n- **Dependencies:** Third-party libraries MUST undergo security vetting (license + CVE scan) recorded in the plan doc before inclusion.\\n- **Documentation:** Every approved ADR MUST note the principle(s) it satisfies, link back to the relevant spec/plan section, and capture any waivers with expiration and owner.\\n\\n## Workflow & Compliance\\n\\n- Feature plans MUST map requirements to the supporting principle evidence before Phase 0 research concludes; missing detail blocks sign-off.\\n- Specs MUST enumerate test evidence (Principle II), UX references (Principle III), performance budgets (Principle IV), and name the accountable owner for each validation before status can move past Draft.\\n- Pull requests MUST reference the governing principle for each non-trivial change and link to the evidence captured in the plan, spec, or ADR.\\n- Waivers granted during review MUST be logged with owner, expiry, and mitigation path in the relevant plan or ADR before merge.\\n- Quarterly, the engineering leads and PM review adherence metrics (lint pass rate, coverage deltas, performance budgets) and publish an audit note in `/docs/ops/`.\\n\\n## Governance\\n\\n- This constitution supersedes contradictory guidance in other docs; conflicts MUST resolve in favor of the latest amended constitution.\\n- Amendments require (1) linked discussion issue, (2) approval from Engineering Lead, Product Lead, and UX, and (3) updated Sync Impact Report plus version bump per SemVer.\\n- Ratification changes (MAJOR versions) require migration guidance for existing specs/plans; MINOR captures new or materially expanded principles; PATCH covers textual clarifications only.\\n- Compliance audits run quarterly; discoverable violations MUST have corrective tasks tracked in Linear within five business days and associated waivers revoked.\\n- Technical decisions (ADR, plan, spec, PR) MUST cite the relevant principle(s), record any granted waivers with an expiration date, and escalate unresolved conflicts to the Engineering Lead before implementation proceeds.\\n\\n**Version**: 1.2.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): Provide original adoption date | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-28\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}
