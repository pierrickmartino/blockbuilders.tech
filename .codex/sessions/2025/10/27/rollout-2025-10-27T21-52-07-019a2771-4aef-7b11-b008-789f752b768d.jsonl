Codex merges this AGENTS.md into context.\n\n## How To Use With Codex\n\n- Codex CLI: run `codex` in this project. Reference an agent naturally, e.g., \"As dev, implement ...\".\n- Codex Web: open this repo and reference roles the same way; Codex reads `AGENTS.md`.\n- Commit `.bmad-core` and this `AGENTS.md` file to your repo so Codex (Web/CLI) can read full agent definitions.\n- Refresh this section after agent updates: `npx bmad-method install -f -i codex`.\n\n### Helpful Commands\n\n- List agents: `npx bmad-method list:agents`\n- Reinstall BMAD core and regenerate AGENTS.md: `npx bmad-method install -f -i codex`\n- Validate configuration: `npx bmad-method validate`\n\n## Agents\n\n### Directory\n\n| Title | ID | When To Use |\n|---|---|---|\n| UX Expert | ux-expert | Use for UI/UX design, wireframes, prototypes, front-end specifications, and user experience optimization |\n| Scrum Master | sm | Use for story creation, epic management, retrospectives in party-mode, and agile process guidance |\n| Test Architect & Quality Advisor | qa | Use for comprehensive test architecture review, quality gate decisions, and code improvement.

Codex merges this AGENTS.md into context.\n\n## How To Use With Codex\n\n- Codex CLI: run `codex` in this project. Reference an agent naturally, e.g., \"As dev, implement ...\".\n- Codex Web: open this repo and reference roles the same way; Codex reads `AGENTS.md`.\n- Commit `.bmad-core` and this `AGENTS.md` file to your repo so Codex (Web/CLI) can read full agent definitions.\n- Refresh this section after agent updates: `npx bmad-method install -f -i codex`.\n\n### Helpful Commands\n\n- List agents: `npx bmad-method list:agents`\n- Reinstall BMAD core and regenerate AGENTS.md: `npx bmad-method install -f -i codex`\n- Validate configuration: `npx bmad-method validate`\n\n## Agents\n\n### Directory\n\n| Title | ID | When To Use |\n|---|---|---|\n| UX Expert | ux-expert | Use for UI/UX design, wireframes, prototypes, front-end specifications, and user experience optimization |\n| Scrum Master | sm | Use for story creation, epic management, retrospectives in party-mode, and agile process guidance |\n| Test Architect & Quality Advisor | qa | Use for comprehensive test architecture review, quality gate decisions, and code improvement.
