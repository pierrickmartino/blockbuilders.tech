Codex merges this AGENTS.md into context.\n\n## How To Use With Codex\n\n- Codex CLI: run `codex` in this project. Reference an agent naturally, e.g., \"As dev, implement ...\".\n- Codex Web: open this repo and reference roles the same way; Codex reads `AGENTS.md`.\n- Commit `.bmad-core` and this `AGENTS.md` file to your repo so Codex (Web/CLI) can read full agent definitions.\n- Refresh this section after agent updates: `npx bmad-method install -f -i codex`.\n\n### Helpful Commands\n\n- List agents: `npx bmad-method list:agents`\n- Reinstall BMAD core and regenerate AGENTS.md: `npx bmad-method install -f -i codex`\n- Validate configuration: `npx bmad-method validate`\n\n## Agents\n\n### Directory\n\n| Title | ID | When To Use |\n|---|---|---|\n| UX Expert | ux-expert | Use for UI/UX design, wireframes, prototypes, front-end specifications, and user experience optimization |\n| Scrum Master | sm | Use for story creation, epic management, retrospectives in party-mode, and agile process guidance |\n| Test Architect & Quality Advisor | qa | Use for comprehensive test architecture review, quality gate decisions, and code improvement.

Codex merges this AGENTS.md into context.\n\n## How To Use With Codex\n\n- Codex CLI: run `codex` in this project. Reference an agent naturally, e.g., \"As dev, implement ...\".\n- Codex Web: open this repo and reference roles the same way; Codex reads `AGENTS.md`.\n- Commit `.bmad-core` and this `AGENTS.md` file to your repo so Codex (Web/CLI) can read full agent definitions.\n- Refresh this section after agent updates: `npx bmad-method install -f -i codex`.\n\n### Helpful Commands\n\n- List agents: `npx bmad-method list:agents`\n- Reinstall BMAD core and regenerate AGENTS.md: `npx bmad-method install -f -i codex`\n- Validate configuration: `npx bmad-method validate`\n\n## Agents\n\n### Directory\n\n| Title | ID | When To Use |\n|---|---|---|\n| UX Expert | ux-expert | Use for UI/UX design, wireframes, prototypes, front-end specifications, and user experience optimization |\n| Scrum Master | sm | Use for story creation, epic management, retrospectives in party-mode, and agile process guidance |\n| Test Architect & Quality Advisor | qa | Use for comprehensive test architecture review, quality gate decisions, and code improvement.

The product centers on a drag-and-drop canvas, trustworthy simulations, and guided learning so builders can reach their first win fast and scale into cohort-ready workflows.\\n\\n## Quick Start for Contributors\\n\\n> ⚠️ The codebase is being scaffolded (see planned structure below). These steps capture the agreed setup so you can hit the ground running as soon as the monorepo lands.\\n\\n### 1. Install Prerequisites\\n\\n```bash\\nbrew install node@20 pnpm python@3.11 poetry redis awscli pre-commit\\nbrew install --cask docker\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Bootstrap the Monorepo\\n\\n```bash\\npnpm install\\npoetry install --sync --no-root --directory apps/api\\npoetry install --sync --no-root --directory apps/workers\\ncp .env.example .env\\ncp apps/web/.env.local.example apps/web/.env.local\\npre-commit install\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Run the Stack\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker compose up redis timescale -d\\npnpm turbo run dev --parallel     # launches web, FastAPI, and Celery worker together\\n```\\n\\nUseful one-offs:\\n\\n- `pnpm --filter web dev` — frontend only\\n- `pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/api dev` — FastAPI with reload via poetry/uvicorn\\n- `pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/workers dev` — Celery worker using poetry\\n- `pnpm turbo run test` / `poetry run pytest` — JS/TS and Python tests\\n- `python scripts/mock_datadog_agent.py --port 8282` — local Datadog shim that echoes audit log payloads for instrumentation checks\\n\\nEnvironment variables are documented in `docs/architecture.md#environment-configuration`. Copy `.env.example` as above and fill in Supabase, Stripe, and AWS secrets from 1Password.\\n\\n## Planned Repository Shape\\n\\nThe monorepo will follow the architecture blueprint:\\n\\n```text\\nblockbuilders/\\n├── apps/\\n│   ├── web/                     # Next.js App Router UI\\n│   ├── api/                     # FastAPI service\\n│   └── workers/                 # Celery workloads\\n├── packages/                    # Shared types, design system, API client\\n├── infrastructure/              # Terraform & deployment manifests\\n├── scripts/                     # Local tooling and automation\\n├── turbo.json / pnpm-workspace.yaml\\n├── .env.example / docs/\\n└── ...\\n```\\n\\nCheck `docs/architecture.md#unified-project-structure` for the authoritative layout, build commands, and CI/CD flow.\\n\\n## Key Product Docs\\n\\n- [Product Requirements Document](docs/prd.md) — source of truth for scope, success metrics, and phased roadmap (v1.7).\\n- [Fullstack Architecture](docs/architecture.md) — monorepo structure, service contracts, deployment plan, and operational runbooks (v0.4).\\n- [UI/UX Specification](docs/front-end-spec.md) — personas, flows, component inventory, and visual guardrails (v0.3).\\n- [Project Brief](docs/brief.md) — market context, research timeline, and risk tracker for PM/leadership syncs.\\n- [Engineering Constitution](.specify/memory/constitution.md) - non-negotiable principles for code quality, testing, UX consistency, and performance governance (v1.0.0).\\n\\n## Collaboration Rituals\\n\\n- **PR workflow:** feature branches → PR with linked story → CI green → PM/QA sign-off → squash merge to `main`.\\n- **Status updates:** async standup in Linear each morning; beta KPI scorecard reviewed every Friday.\\n- **Research intake:** log interviews and competitive findings in the shared Notion hub within 24 hours.\\n\\nQuestions or onboarding blockers?
