Codex merges this AGENTS.md into context.\n\n## How To Use With Codex\n\n- Codex CLI: run `codex` in this project. Reference an agent naturally, e.g., \"As dev, implement ...\".\n- Codex Web: open this repo and reference roles the same way; Codex reads `AGENTS.md`.\n- Commit `.bmad-core` and this `AGENTS.md` file to your repo so Codex (Web/CLI) can read full agent definitions.\n- Refresh this section after agent updates: `npx bmad-method install -f -i codex`.\n\n### Helpful Commands\n\n- List agents: `npx bmad-method list:agents`\n- Reinstall BMAD core and regenerate AGENTS.md: `npx bmad-method install -f -i codex`\n- Validate configuration: `npx bmad-method validate`\n\n## Agents\n\n### Directory\n\n| Title | ID | When To Use |\n|---|---|---|\n| UX Expert | ux-expert | Use for UI/UX design, wireframes, prototypes, front-end specifications, and user experience optimization |\n| Scrum Master | sm | Use for story creation, epic management, retrospectives in party-mode, and agile process guidance |\n| Test Architect & Quality Advisor | qa | Use for comprehensive test architecture review, quality gate decisions, and code improvement.

Codex merges this AGENTS.md into context.\n\n## How To Use With Codex\n\n- Codex CLI: run `codex` in this project. Reference an agent naturally, e.g., \"As dev, implement ...\".\n- Codex Web: open this repo and reference roles the same way; Codex reads `AGENTS.md`.\n- Commit `.bmad-core` and this `AGENTS.md` file to your repo so Codex (Web/CLI) can read full agent definitions.\n- Refresh this section after agent updates: `npx bmad-method install -f -i codex`.\n\n### Helpful Commands\n\n- List agents: `npx bmad-method list:agents`\n- Reinstall BMAD core and regenerate AGENTS.md: `npx bmad-method install -f -i codex`\n- Validate configuration: `npx bmad-method validate`\n\n## Agents\n\n### Directory\n\n| Title | ID | When To Use |\n|---|---|---|\n| UX Expert | ux-expert | Use for UI/UX design, wireframes, prototypes, front-end specifications, and user experience optimization |\n| Scrum Master | sm | Use for story creation, epic management, retrospectives in party-mode, and agile process guidance |\n| Test Architect & Quality Advisor | qa | Use for comprehensive test architecture review, quality gate decisions, and code improvement.

The product centers on a drag-and-drop canvas, trustworthy simulations, and guided learning so builders can reach their first win fast and scale into cohort-ready workflows.\\n\\n## Quick Start for Contributors\\n\\n> ⚠️ The codebase is being scaffolded (see planned structure below). These steps capture the agreed setup so you can hit the ground running as soon as the monorepo lands.\\n\\n### 1. Install Prerequisites\\n\\n```bash\\nbrew install node@20 pnpm python@3.11 poetry redis awscli pre-commit\\nbrew install --cask docker\\n```\\n\\n### 2. Bootstrap the Monorepo\\n\\n```bash\\npnpm install\\npoetry install --sync --no-root --directory apps/api\\npoetry install --sync --no-root --directory apps/workers\\ncp .env.example .env\\ncp apps/web/.env.local.example apps/web/.env.local\\npre-commit install\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Run the Stack\\n\\n```bash\\ndocker compose up redis timescale -d\\npnpm turbo run dev --parallel     # launches web, FastAPI, and Celery worker together\\n```\\n\\nUseful one-offs:\\n\\n- `pnpm --filter web dev` — frontend only\\n- `pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/api dev` — FastAPI with reload via poetry/uvicorn\\n- `pnpm --filter @blockbuilders/workers dev` — Celery worker using poetry\\n- `pnpm turbo run test` / `poetry run pytest` — JS/TS and Python tests\\n- `python scripts/mock_datadog_agent.py --port 8282` — local Datadog shim that echoes audit log payloads for instrumentation checks\\n\\nEnvironment variables are documented in `docs/architecture.md#environment-configuration`.

Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\\n4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo\\n5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories\\n\\n### Parallel Team Strategy\\n\\nWith multiple developers:\\n\\n1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together\\n2. Once Foundational is done:\\n   - Developer A: User Story 1\\n   - Developer B: User Story 2\\n   - Developer C: User Story 3\\n3.

add guidance once commands exist)\n+Follow-up TODOs:\n+- TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): Provide original adoption date\n+-->\n+\n+# Blockbuilders Engineering Constitution\n+\n+## Core Principles\n+\n+### Principle I — Code Quality Stewardship\n+\n+- CI MUST block merges unless linting, formatting, static analysis, and type checks pass for every affected workspace.\n+- New or modified modules MUST provide typed public contracts and module-level documentation (README or docstring) before they can be consumed by another package.\n+- Architectural boundaries between `apps/*` and `packages/*` MUST remain acyclic; introduce a new dependency only with an ADR recorded in `docs/architecture/decisions/`.\n+- Code owners MUST reject pull requests that exceed cyclomatic complexity 10 or 30 executable lines per function unless the PR links a mitigation plan in the spec/plan.\n+\n+**Rationale:** Stable, well-documented modules prevent cascading regressions and keep the monorepo maintainable as more strategy tooling ships.\n+\n+### Principle II — Test-First Evidence\n+\n+- Every feature branch MUST add or update automated tests that fail before implementation and pass afterward; merging without test evidence is prohibited.\n+- Services MUST maintain ≥85% statement coverage on all files touched by the change; lower coverage requires an explicit waiver logged in `specs/.../plan.md`.\n+- Critical trading and simulation paths MUST include integration tests (API + worker + data stores) that run in CI pre-merge and nightly.\n+- The test suite MUST be deterministic; flaky tests block merges until quarantined with an issue link and remediation plan.\n+\n+**Rationale:** Evidence-driven development catches regressions early, protecting customer trust in simulations and live-trading outcomes.\n+\n+### Principle III — Consistent User Journeys\n+\n+- Front-end work MUST compose components and tokens from `packages/design-system`; introducing bespoke UI requires documented approval in the spec.\n+- All UI additions MUST pass automated accessibility checks (eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y + Lighthouse) meeting WCAG 2.1 AA for semantic structure, contrast, and keyboard flows.\n+- Feature specs MUST pin the UX reference (e.g., `docs/front-end-spec.md` version) and any deviation MUST include updated mockups reviewed by UX before development starts.\n+- Responsive breakpoints (mobile ≤640px, tablet ≤1024px, desktop >1024px) MUST be validated before release; failing breakpoints require a follow-up task before launch.\n+\n+**Rationale:** Consistent interactions and accessible visuals make the no-code lab feel trustworthy for new builders and power users alike.\n+\n+### Principle IV — Performance Guarantees\n+\n+- The Next.js app MUST sustain Largest Contentful Paint ≤2.5s at p75 on mid-tier hardware (Chrome: Moto G Power profile) before a feature can graduate from QA.\n+- FastAPI endpoints serving trade or simulation data MUST meet ≤200ms p95 latency under 500 req/min synthetic load in the staging stack.\n+- Celery/worker jobs that power backtests MUST finish a 30-day hourly dataset within 5 minutes; longer runtimes require sliced execution plans documented in the spec.\n+- Every feature plan MUST specify the metric sources (Datadog dashboards, Chrome traces, pytest perf markers) that will demonstrate budget compliance post-release.\n+\n+**Rationale:** Performance determines whether strategy iteration feels immediate or unusable; guarding budgets keeps the lab viable for realtime decision-making.\n+\n+## Implementation Guardrails\n+\n+- Instrumentation: All services MUST emit structured logs with correlation IDs, latency, and error codes; metrics and traces MUST flow to Datadog before feature launch.\n+- Secrets: Environment configuration MUST come from `.env` templates checked into the repo; hard-coded secrets or ad-hoc env vars are forbidden.\n+- Dependencies: Third-party libraries MUST undergo security vetting (license + CVE scan) recorded in the plan doc before inclusion.\n+- Documentation: Every approved ADR MUST note the principle(s) it satisfies and link back to the relevant spec/plan section.\n+\n+## Workflow & Compliance\n+\n+- Feature plans MUST document how each principle is satisfied; missing detail blocks Phase 0 research sign-off.\n+- Specs MUST enumerate test evidence (Principle II), UX references (Principle III), and performance budgets (Principle IV) before status can move past Draft.\n+- Pull requests MUST reference the governing principle for each non-trivial change in the PR description checklist.\n+- Quarterly, the engineering leads and PM review adherence metrics (lint pass rate, coverage deltas, performance budgets) and publish an audit note in `/docs/ops/`.\n+\n+## Governance\n+\n+- This constitution supersedes contradictory guidance in other docs; conflicts MUST resolve in favor of the latest amended constitution.\n+- Amendments require (1) linked discussion issue, (2) approval from Engineering Lead, Product Lead, and UX, and (3) updated Sync Impact Report plus version bump per SemVer.\n+- Ratification changes (MAJOR versions) require migration guidance for existing specs/plans; MINOR captures new principles; PATCH covers textual clarifications only.\n+- Compliance audits run quarterly; discoverable violations MUST have corrective tasks tracked in Linear within five business days.\n+- Technical decisions (ADR, plan, spec, PR) MUST cite the relevant principle(s) and record any granted waivers with an expiration date.\n+\n+**Version**: 1.1.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): Provide original adoption date | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-27\n*** End Patch"}}

suppression requires an approved, time-boxed remediation plan documented in the implementation plan.\\n-- Implementation plans and specs MUST call out refactors or debt paydown necessary to keep modules cohesive; code review MUST block hidden coupling, shared mutable state, or abstractions without owners.\\n-- Shared libraries MUST expose typed, documented contracts and changelogs; breaking changes demand a migration note and version bump synchronized across dependents.\\n+### Principle I — Code Quality Stewardship\\n \\n-**Rationale**\\n-High-quality code keeps the rapidly evolving monorepo maintainable, enabling safe reuse and faster iteration.\\n+- CI MUST block merges unless linting, formatting, static analysis, and type checks pass for every affected workspace.\\n+- New or modified modules MUST provide typed public contracts and module-level documentation (README or docstring) before they can be consumed by another package.\\n+- Architectural boundaries between `apps/*` and `packages/*` MUST remain acyclic; introduce a new dependency only with an ADR recorded in `docs/architecture/decisions/`.\\n+- Code owners MUST reject pull requests that exceed cyclomatic complexity 10 or 30 executable lines per function unless the PR links a mitigation plan in the spec/plan.\\n \\n-### Contract-Led Testing Discipline\\n-**Non-Negotiables**\\n-- Every feature spec MUST enumerate unit, integration, end-to-end, and non-functional tests that prove each acceptance scenario before implementation starts; plans must schedule when those tests fail first (red) and pass (green).\\n-- CI pipelines MUST block merges until all mandated tests run green, including contract tests for APIs, worker smoke suites, and frontend journeys; touched modules MUST sustain >=85% statement coverage with any gaps justified in the QA record.\\n-- Nightly jobs MUST execute load/backtest harnesses and alert on regressions; failures pause new releases until resolved with documented root cause analysis.\\n+**Rationale:** Stable, well-documented modules prevent cascading regressions and keep the monorepo maintainable as more strategy tooling ships.\\n \\n-**Rationale**\\n-Testing first protects product integrity, uncovers regressions early, and keeps confidence high for continuous delivery.\\n+### Principle II — Test-First Evidence\\n \\n-### Unified Experience Consistency\\n-**Non-Negotiables**\\n-- User-facing work MUST map each component to the canonical design system tokens and patterns in `docs/front-end-spec.md`; deviations require UX approval captured in the spec's decision log.\\n-- All flows MUST satisfy WCAG 2.1 AA, declare responsive breakpoints, and define consistent loading, empty, and error treatments before implementation.\\n-- Copy, onboarding, and in-app education updates MUST route through UX review and localization checks that land in the relevant quickstart or documentation updates.\\n+- Every feature branch MUST add or update automated tests that fail before implementation and pass afterward; merging without test evidence is prohibited.\\n+- Services MUST maintain ≥85% statement coverage on all files touched by the change; lower coverage requires an explicit waiver logged in `specs/.../plan.md`.\\n+- Critical trading\\n[... output truncated to fit 10240 bytes ...]\\n\\n-3. **Execution Gate** - `/speckit.tasks` MUST tie every task to its corresponding tests, UX acceptance, and performance verification; no development task closes without linked test execution evidence.\\n-4. **Release Gate** - CI, QA, and UX sign-offs confirm principle compliance; unresolved variances escalate to the governance review for decision or rollback.\\n+- Feature plans MUST document how each principle is satisfied; missing detail blocks Phase 0 research sign-off.\\n+- Specs MUST enumerate test evidence (Principle II), UX references (Principle III), and performance budgets (Principle IV) before status can move past Draft.\\n+- Pull requests MUST reference the governing principle for each non-trivial change in the PR description checklist.\\n+- Quarterly, the engineering leads and PM review adherence metrics (lint pass rate, coverage deltas, performance budgets) and publish an audit note in `/docs/ops/`.\\n \\n ## Governance\\n \\n-- **Authority** - This constitution supersedes conflicting documentation; engineering decisions that diverge from it are invalid until amended.\\n-- **Amendments** - Changes require a PR describing rationale, impact analysis, and updates to affected templates or guidance. Approval from Engineering Lead, Product Lead, and QA Lead is mandatory before merge.\\n-- **Versioning Policy** - Semantic versioning governs updates: MAJOR for principle redefinitions or removals, MINOR for new principles or governance steps, PATCH for clarifications. Version increments occur within the amendment PR.\\n-- **Compliance Review** - Quarterly audits sample features to verify principle adherence, retrospectives document variances, and corrective actions feed the backlog with tracked owners and due dates.\\n+- This constitution supersedes contradictory guidance in other docs; conflicts MUST resolve in favor of the latest amended constitution.\\n+- Amendments require (1) linked discussion issue, (2) approval from Engineering Lead, Product Lead, and UX, and (3) updated Sync Impact Report plus version bump per SemVer.\\n+- Ratification changes (MAJOR versions) require migration guidance for existing specs/plans; MINOR captures new principles; PATCH covers textual clarifications only.\\n+- Compliance audits run quarterly; discoverable violations MUST have corrective tasks tracked in Linear within five business days.\\n+- Technical decisions (ADR, plan, spec, PR) MUST cite the relevant principle(s) and record any granted waivers with an expiration date.\\n \\n-**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-10-27 | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-27\\n+**Version**: 1.1.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): Provide original adoption date | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-27\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}

introduce a new dependency only with an ADR recorded in `docs/architecture/decisions/`.\\n    33\\t- Code owners MUST reject pull requests that exceed cyclomatic complexity 10 or 30 executable lines per function unless the PR links a mitigation plan in the spec/plan.\\n    34\\t\\n    35\\t**Rationale:** Stable, well-documented modules prevent cascading regressions and keep the monorepo maintainable as more strategy tooling ships.\\n    36\\t\\n    37\\t### Principle II — Test-First Evidence\\n    38\\t\\n    39\\t- Every feature branch MUST add or update automated tests that fail before implementation and pass afterward; merging without test evidence is prohibited.\\n    40\\t- Services MUST maintain ≥85% statement coverage on all files touched by the change; lower coverage requires an explicit waiver logged in `specs/.../plan.md`.\\n    41\\t- Critical trading and simulation paths MUST include integration tests (API + worker + data stores) that run in CI pre-merge and nightly.\\n    42\\t- The test suite MUST be deterministic; flaky tests block merges until quarantined with an issue link and remediation plan.\\n    43\\t\\n    44\\t**Rationale:** Evidence-driven development catches regressions early, protecting customer trust in simulations and live-trading outcomes.\\n    45\\t\\n    46\\t### Principle III — Consistent User Journeys\\n    47\\t\\n    48\\t- Front-end work MUST compose components and tokens from `packages/design-system`; introducing bespoke UI requires documented approval in the spec.\\n    49\\t- All UI additions MUST pass automated accessibility checks (eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y + Lighthouse) meeting WCAG 2.1 AA for semantic structure, contrast, and keyboard flows.\\n    50\\t- Feature specs MUST pin the UX reference (e.g., `docs/front-end-spec.md` version) and any deviation MUST include updated mockups reviewed by UX before development starts.\\n    51\\t- Responsive breakpoints (mobile ≤640px, tablet ≤1024px, desktop >1024px) MUST be validated before release; failing breakpoints require a follow-up task before launch.\\n    52\\t\\n    53\\t**Rationale:** Consistent interactions and accessible visuals make the no-code lab feel trustworthy for new builders and power users alike.\\n    54\\t\\n    55\\t### Principle IV — Performance Guarantees\\n    56\\t\\n    57\\t- The Next.js app MUST sustain Largest Contentful Paint ≤2.5s at p75 on mid-tier hardware (Chrome: Moto G Power profile) before a feature can graduate from QA.\\n    58\\t- FastAPI endpoints serving trade or simulation data MUST meet ≤200ms p95 latency under 500 req/min synthetic load in the staging stack.\\n    59\\t- Celery/worker jobs that power backtests MUST finish a 30-day hourly dataset within 5 minutes; longer runtimes require sliced execution plans documented in the spec.\\n    60\\t- Every feature plan MUST specify the metric sources (Datadog dashboards, Chrome traces, pytest perf markers) that will demonstrate budget compliance post-release.\\n    61\\t\\n    62\\t**Rationale:** Performance determines whether strategy iteration feels immediate or unusable; guarding budgets keeps the lab viable for realtime decision-making.\\n    63\\t\\n    64\\t## Implementation Guardrails\\n    65\\t\\n    66\\t- Instrumentation: All services MUST emit structured logs with correlation IDs, latency, and error codes; metrics and traces MUST flow to Datadog before feature launch.\\n    67\\t- Secrets: Environment configuration MUST come from `.env` templates checked into the repo; hard-coded secrets or ad-hoc env vars are forbidden.\\n    68\\t- Dependencies: Third-party libraries MUST undergo security vetting (license + CVE scan) recorded in the plan doc before inclusion.\\n    69\\t- Documentation: Every approved ADR MUST note the principle(s) it satisfies and link back to the relevant spec/plan section.\\n    70\\t\\n    71\\t## Workflow & Compliance\\n    72\\t\\n    73\\t- Feature plans MUST document how each principle is satisfied; missing detail blocks Phase 0 research sign-off.\\n    74\\t- Specs MUST enumerate test evidence (Principle II), UX references (Principle III), and performance budgets (Principle IV) before status can move past Draft.\\n    75\\t- Pull requests MUST reference the governing principle for each non-trivial change in the PR description checklist.\\n    76\\t- Quarterly, the engineering leads and PM review adherence metrics (lint pass rate, coverage deltas, performance budgets) and publish an audit note in `/docs/ops/`.\\n    77\\t\\n    78\\t## Governance\\n    79\\t\\n    80\\t- This constitution supersedes contradictory guidance in other docs; conflicts MUST resolve in favor of the latest amended constitution.\\n    81\\t- Amendments require (1) linked discussion issue, (2) approval from Engineering Lead, Product Lead, and UX, and (3) updated Sync Impact Report plus version bump per SemVer.\\n    82\\t- Ratification changes (MAJOR versions) require migration guidance for existing specs/plans; MINOR captures new principles; PATCH covers textual clarifications only.\\n    83\\t- Compliance audits run quarterly; discoverable violations MUST have corrective tasks tracked in Linear within five business days.\\n    84\\t- Technical decisions (ADR, plan, spec, PR) MUST cite the relevant principle(s) and record any granted waivers with an expiration date.\\n    85\\t\\n    86\\t**Version**: 1.1.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): Provide original adoption date | **Last Amended**: 2025-10-27\\n\",\"metadata\":{\"exit_code\":0,\"duration_seconds\":0.0}}"}}
