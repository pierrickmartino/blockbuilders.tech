# Feature Specification: Platform Skeleton Onboarding

**Feature Branch**: `001-bootstrap-auth-onboarding`  
**Created**: 2025-10-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Deliver a shared web/API/worker skeleton that future features can rely on, enforce login with a stored simulation-consent checkbox so only compliant users proceed, auto- provision a demo workspace after login to showcase value immediately, and log every auth and workspace event to keep compliance and operations fully informed."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Consent-Gated Sign-In (Priority: P1)

As a prospective strategist, I confirm simulation-only usage terms, create or access my account, and reach the platform home without manual assistance.

**Why this priority**: Without a trustable entry point that enforces compliance guardrails, the product cannot onboard any user safely.

**Independent Test**: A tester can sign in with a blank profile, confirm consent, and reach the authenticated landing page in a single session while observing that access is blocked until consent is given.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user on the sign-in page, **When** they acknowledge the simulation-only terms and submit valid credentials, **Then** they reach the authenticated landing view without additional setup required.
2. **Given** a new user on the sign-in page, **When** they attempt to continue without acknowledging the simulation-only terms, **Then** the system blocks access and explains why consent is required.

### User Story 2 - Guided Demo Workspace (Priority: P2)

As a newly authenticated strategist, I land in a pre-configured demo workspace that showcases a working strategy and guides me through the first exploratory actions.

**Why this priority**: Immediate exposure to a working example reduces abandonment and accelerates the “time to value” metric for new accounts.

**Independent Test**: A tester can sign in, confirm the presence of the seeded workspace, follow the guided steps, and verify that key demo actions (viewing blocks, reviewing callouts) complete without needing production data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a first-time authenticated user, **When** the post-login redirect completes, **Then** a demo workspace with sample strategy elements is available and highlighted.
2. **Given** a first-time authenticated user, **When** they dismiss or complete the onboarding prompts, **Then** the prompts update to reflect progress without reappearing unnecessarily.

---

### User Story 3 - Compliance Traceability (Priority: P3)

As a compliance or operations reviewer, I retrieve a chronological record of consent acknowledgements, sign-ins, and workspace provisioning events when investigating user access.

**Why this priority**: The platform must demonstrate responsible controls to regulators and partners; missing traceability stalls go-live approvals.

**Independent Test**: A reviewer can pull a report for a given user and confirm that consent capture, login activity, and workspace initialization events are all logged with timestamps and identifiers.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an operations reviewer with standard access, **When** they request history for a specific user, **Then** the log includes consent status, login time, and workspace actions in order.
2. **Given** an operations reviewer auditing the system, **When** they query for recent consent denials, **Then** the log highlights attempts that were blocked for lack of acknowledgement.

### Edge Cases

- How should the system respond when a returning user’s previous consent record is missing or stale?
- What feedback is provided if demo workspace seeding fails but authentication succeeds?
- How are duplicate audit entries prevented when a user refreshes the page during provisioning?
- What happens if a user withdraws consent after initial acceptance?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The platform MUST provide a cohesive project skeleton that bundles user-facing surfaces, service endpoints, worker processes, and shared domain definitions so future work can extend a single, consistent structure.
- **FR-002**: The platform MUST enforce a simulation-only consent acknowledgement before granting authenticated access, preventing any interaction until the user confirms acceptance.
- **FR-003**: The platform MUST persist each consent acknowledgement with user identifier, timestamp, and consent version so compliance teams can verify historical agreements.
- **FR-004**: The platform MUST seed a demo workspace with a representative strategy and instructional prompts for every first-time authenticated user.
- **FR-005**: The platform MUST allow returning users to bypass re-seeding when a demo workspace already exists while ensuring they still land in an active workspace.
- **FR-006**: The platform MUST record audit entries for consent decisions, successful sign-ins, blocked attempts, and workspace provisioning outcomes with sufficient context for investigations.
- **FR-007**: The platform MUST surface clear messaging and recovery guidance whenever demo provisioning or consent persistence fails, preserving user trust.

### Quality Constraints *(Constitution Alignment)*

- **Code Quality (Principle I)**: Product engineering leadership owns documentation of the shared skeleton, ensuring updated architecture notes and onboarding guides explain how teams extend the structure.
- **Testing (Principle II)**: Quality engineering will define independent checks for consent gating, workspace seeding, and audit availability, targeting automated coverage across entry, recovery, and regression scenarios.
- **User Experience (Principle III)**: The design team will review consent messaging and onboarding callouts for clarity, accessibility compliance, and alignment with brand tone before release.
- **Performance (Principle IV)**: Platform reliability will monitor that login-to-workspace load completes within acceptable onboarding thresholds and flag any regression in time-to-first-workspace.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **User Access Profile**: Represents a person’s credentials, consent status, and first-login metadata required to manage sign-in eligibility.
- **Demo Workspace**: Represents the pre-configured environment (strategy name, instructional elements, ownership) tied to a user’s account to illustrate platform value.
- **Access Audit Event**: Represents traceable records of consent decisions, authentication attempts, and workspace provisioning results linked to user profiles and timestamps.

## Assumptions & Dependencies

- Existing account creation and identity verification tooling remains available for reuse without modification.
- Compliance teams have access to the organization’s standard reporting portal to review audit data.
- Product marketing will provide the content for onboarding prompts and demo strategy narrative before release.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 90% of new users reach the authenticated landing page within two minutes of starting sign-in, including consent acknowledgement.
- **SC-002**: 95% of first-time users arrive in a seeded demo workspace without manual support intervention.
- **SC-003**: Compliance reviewers can retrieve a complete consent and access history for any user in under 30 seconds with zero missing entries.
- **SC-004**: Onboarding-related support tickets decline by 40% compared to the pre-feature baseline across the first month of release.
