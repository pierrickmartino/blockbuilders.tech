Story Validation

  - Template Compliance Issues: Dev Notes omit the required ### Testing subsection defined in the story template, so mandated guidance on frameworks, locations, and commands never
    reaches the dev agent (docs/stories/1.1.platform-skeleton-authentication.md:55).
  - Critical Issues: Without that Testing subsection the story is blocked; developers are left to infer coverage expectations despite the template demanding explicit standards
    before implementation (docs/stories/1.1.platform-skeleton-authentication.md:46, docs/stories/1.1.platform-skeleton-authentication.md:55).
  - Should-Fix Issues: Source citations for the onboarding checklist drop the docs/ prefix, breaking the trace back to the authoritative spec (docs/stories/1.1.platform-skeleton-
    authentication.md:37, docs/stories/1.1.platform-skeleton-authentication.md:68); OAuth work lacks the staging/domain prerequisites called out in the PRD, so the story should
    surface those dependencies to avoid missed setup windows (docs/prd.md:290, docs/prd/epic-1-foundation-guided-strategy-canvas.md:12, docs/stories/1.1.platform-skeleton-
    authentication.md:24).
  - Nice-to-Have Improvements: None identified.
  - Anti-Hallucination Findings: Aside from the onboarding spec path typo, all references map cleanly to architecture and PRD sources; no invented components detected.
  - Final Assessment: NO-GO â€” Implementation Readiness 6/10, Confidence Medium.
  - Next Steps: 1) Add the Testing subsection under Dev Notes with the required standards and links. 2) Fix the onboarding spec references and bring in the OAuth staging/
    dependency guidance from the PRD.
