Validation Report

  - Template Compliance Issues: None observed; all template sections are present and populated without placeholders.
  - Critical Issues: None; the story is implementable once the minor gap below is addressed.
  - Should-Fix Issues: Testing guidance references a helper at tests/utils/datadog_sink.py without instructing the dev to create or populate it, which can stall telemetry
    validation work—add an explicit deliverable for that utility (docs/stories/1.1.platform-skeleton-authentication.md:53).
  - Nice-to-Have Improvements: Consider pointing developers to the intended GitHub Actions workflow filename(s) so the CI task is less open-ended (docs/stories/1.1.platform-
    skeleton-authentication.md:21).
  - Anti-Hallucination Findings: All cited architecture/PRD sources exist; no unsupported technical claims detected.
  - Final Assessment: GO — Implementation Readiness Score 8/10, Confidence High.
