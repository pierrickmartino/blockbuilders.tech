Validate Story 1.1


Template Compliance

  - No gaps; docs/stories/1.1.platform-skeleton-authentication.md follows the story template and contains no leftover placeholders.

  Critical Issues

  - docs/stories/1.1.platform-skeleton-authentication.md:24-27 cover backend auth tasks but never instruct how or where we surface and require the simulation-consent checkbox in
    the Next.js UI, leaving AC2 unenforceable for the user flow.
  - docs/stories/1.1.platform-skeleton-authentication.md:90 flags that no schema exists for storing consent, yet the story offers no decision or follow-up task to resolve where
    that data will live, so implementation would stall on an undefined persistence model.

  Should-Fix Issues

  - docs/stories/1.1.platform-skeleton-authentication.md:31-34,61 introduce onboarding callout IDs without any supporting spec; please document the checklist/callout configuration
    so devs know the source of truth and expected copy.
  - docs/stories/1.1.platform-skeleton-authentication.md:33,44,66 require invoking the PlanUsage quota service but give no guidance on which service method, thresholds, or event
    hooks to call; add precise integration points to avoid guesswork.
  - docs/stories/1.1.platform-skeleton-authentication.md:39,45,83 expect Datadog log-based monitors and telemetry assertions, yet we lack instructions for how to exercise or mock
    those integrations during development; clarify tooling or adjust expectations so testing is actionable.

  Nice-to-Have Improvements

  - Consider consolidating the duplicated testing guidance (docs/stories/1.1.platform-skeleton-authentication.md:41-46 vs. 80-103) so the dev agent has a single authoritative
    checklist.

  Anti-Hallucination Findings

  - Callout IDs such as welcome-consent, canvas-tour, edit-parameters, and run-first-backtest (docs/stories/1.1.platform-skeleton-authentication.md:34,61) are not referenced in
    PRD or architecture artifacts—please cite their origin or adjust them to match documented assets.
  - The “Quickstart Momentum” demo strategy definition (docs/stories/1.1.platform-skeleton-authentication.md:32,59-60) is not sourced from shared documents; either link to the
    supporting artifact or capture it as a new requirement explicitly.
  - Datadog index names service:auth and service:workspace (docs/stories/1.1.platform-skeleton-authentication.md:39) have no traceable mention in monitoring docs; confirm these
    labels or align them with documented nomenclature.

  Final Assessment

  - Decision: NO-GO until the blocking consent-flow items are resolved.
  - Implementation Readiness Score: 6/10.
  - Confidence Level: Medium—most architecture hooks are referenced, but the consent workflow and telemetry specs need clarification.

  Let me know when you’ve updated the story and I’ll re-run validation.
