# Product Owner Master Checklist – Blockbuilders

_Date:_ 2025-10-09
_Agent:_ Sarah (Product Owner)
_Mode:_ Comprehensive (full checklist)

## Executive Summary
- **Project Type:** Greenfield with full-stack UI (Next.js + FastAPI).
- **Overall Readiness:** ~83% (6 ✅ / 3 ⚠️ / 0 ❌ across 9 evaluated categories).
- **Go/No-Go:** Conditional Go – deliver missing ops playbooks before sprint kickoff.
- **Critical Blockers:** 1 (ops playbooks referenced for seeding/DNS are not yet in repo).
- **Sections Skipped:** Brownfield-only items in 1.2, 2.*, 3.*, 7.*, and brownfield checks in 10.1/10.2.

## Category Results
| Category | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Project Setup & Initialization | ✅ Pass | Epic 1 establishes the monorepo, auth, and onboarding scaffolding, backed by explicit local setup tooling and env guidance (docs/prd.md:303, docs/architecture.md:1155). |
| 2. Infrastructure & Deployment | ⚠️ Partial | Deployment, CI/CD, and data bootstrapping flows are mapped, but the required `ops/playbooks` assets they reference are absent, so run execution still depends on tribal knowledge (docs/architecture.md:1220-1305). |
| 3. External Dependencies & Integrations | ⚠️ Partial | Provisioning ownership for Supabase, AWS, Stripe, and market data is documented, yet the centralised runbooks these instructions cite are not present, leaving onboarding steps unenforceable (docs/prd.md:244-249, docs/architecture.md:1307-1310). |
| 4. UI/UX Considerations | ✅ Pass | UX spec covers personas, flows, accessibility, and component inventory with metrics to measure success (docs/front-end-spec.md:6-146). |
| 5. User/Agent Responsibility | ✅ Pass | Responsibility matrix clarifies human vs. automation ownership for compliance, incidents, and support cadences (docs/prd.md:268-276). |
| 6. Feature Sequencing & Dependencies | ✅ Pass | Epics and stories sequence foundations → data → monitoring → sharing, keeping dependencies explicit (docs/prd.md:303-437). |
| 7. Risk Management (Brownfield) | ⏭️ N/A | Greenfield build; brownfield-only controls skipped per checklist rule. |
| 8. MVP Scope Alignment | ✅ Pass | MVP boundaries, deferrals, and validation KPIs are spelled out with clear must/should scope (docs/prd.md:109-136). |
| 9. Documentation & Handoff | ⚠️ Partial | Release notes, ops logs, and knowledge-transfer packets are planned, but no code-review or runbook artifacts exist yet to operationalise them (docs/prd.md:283-288). |
| 10. Post-MVP Considerations | ✅ Pass | Future phases and extensibility roadmap are catalogued, highlighting deferred enhancements (docs/prd.md:124-127). |

## Project-Specific Analysis (Greenfield)
- **Setup completeness:** Monorepo bootstrap, local environment, and CI instructions are production-grade; missing playbooks are the lone gap (docs/architecture.md:1155, docs/architecture.md:1291-1305).
- **Dependency sequencing:** Stories align with prerequisite services and backlogs, minimising cross-epic contention (docs/prd.md:303-437).
- **MVP scope appropriateness:** In/out-of-scope lists keep beta focused on guided wins without overreaching into educator automation (docs/prd.md:109-127).
- **Timeline feasibility:** Outstanding risks are operational, not architectural; once playbooks materialise, schedule remains realistic (docs/prd.md:290-299).

## Risk Assessment
1. **Runbooks missing for critical ops flows (High severity, Medium likelihood):** Architecture/PRD assume `ops/playbooks` exists for seeding and DNS/SSL, but repo is empty; without them on-call teams lack executable guidance (docs/architecture.md:1291-1305, docs/prd.md:244-265).
2. **Ops documentation debt (Medium severity, Medium likelihood):** Release notes, beta logs, and knowledge-transfer packets are promised but templates/processes are still conceptual (docs/prd.md:283-288).
3. **Market data vendor decision pending (Medium severity, Medium likelihood):** Vendor evaluation remains in-flight, so licensing or coverage gaps could delay Epic 2 (docs/prd.md:290-296).
4. **Freemium quota modelling unstarted (Medium severity, Medium likelihood):** Quota definition flagged as "Needs Kickoff," risking churn or cost overruns if delayed (docs/prd.md:290-296).
5. **Compliance workflow still pending (Medium severity, Medium likelihood):** Disclosure audit cadence lacks owners until Sprint 3, so regulatory readiness demands tracking (docs/prd.md:290-296).

## MVP Completeness
- Core features all trace to MVP must-haves (canvas, backtests, paper trading, onboarding, billing) with acceptance criteria (docs/prd.md:109-437).
- No essential functionality gaps beyond operational readiness; scope creep guarded by explicit deferrals (docs/prd.md:118-127).
- Education and compliance UX requirements align with MVP KPIs ensuring value delivery (docs/front-end-spec.md:6-146).

## Implementation Readiness
- **Developer clarity score:** 9/10 – Architecture, UX, and story acceptance criteria are deeply specified; missing ops artifacts drop one point (docs/architecture.md:99-1230, docs/front-end-spec.md:6-146).
- **Ambiguous requirements:** 1 – Need concrete runbook deliverables/owners for seeding & DNS before dev handoff (docs/architecture.md:1291-1305, docs/prd.md:244-265).
- **Missing technical details:** None beyond runbook execution references; all other interfaces, env vars, and flows are defined (docs/architecture.md:1155-1234).

## Recommendations
- **Must-fix before development:**
  1. Publish the referenced `ops/playbooks/initial-data-seeding.md` and `ops/playbooks/dns-ssl.md`, or update docs to embed the procedures inline (docs/architecture.md:1291-1305, docs/prd.md:244-265).
- **Should-fix for quality:**
  1. Create a lightweight code-review & knowledge-sharing checklist to complement release notes and operations log plans (docs/prd.md:283-288).
  2. Finalise market data vendor selection and document SLA/fallback contracts ahead of Epic 2 start (docs/prd.md:290-296).
- **Consider for improvement:**
  1. Draft templated beta incident log and release note formats to reduce setup friction (docs/prd.md:283-288).
  2. Capture Stripe & Supabase sandbox credentials, mock strategies, and replay test steps in shared secrets documentation (docs/prd.md:244-249).
- **Post-MVP deferrals:** Keep educator automation, ML-driven insights, and advanced analytics deferred per roadmap until MVP metrics stabilise (docs/prd.md:118-127).

## Final Decision
**Decision:** CONDITIONAL – proceed once ops playbooks and review cadence assets land in repo.

## Next Actions
1. Assign owners/dates for the missing playbooks and code-review checklist, and link artifacts back into PRD/architecture when ready.
2. Close the open risk items (vendors, quotas, compliance workflow) during Sprint 0 planning and update the risk register accordingly.
3. Re-run the PO checklist after operational docs are committed to confirm outstanding ⚠️ move to ✅.
