# Product Owner Master Checklist – Blockbuilders

_Date:_ $(date +%Y-%m-%d)
_Agent:_ Sarah (Product Owner)
_Mode:_ YOLO (comprehensive)

## Executive Summary
- **Project Type:** Greenfield with full UI stack (Next.js + FastAPI monorepo).
- **Overall Readiness:** ~95% (98 ✅, 2 ⚠️, 4 ❌ across 104 evaluated items).
- **Go/No-Go:** **Go with targeted pre-flight fixes.**
- **Critical Blockers:** 2 (initial data seeding strategy, DNS/SSL ownership plan).
- **Sections Skipped:** Brownfield-only items in 1.2, 2.1–2.4, 3.1–3.3, 7.*, 8.*, 9.*, 10.* as noted in checklist instructions.

## Category Results
| Category | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Project Setup & Initialization | ✅ Pass | Bootstrap, tooling, and environment guidance are thorough (`docs/prd.md:200`, `docs/architecture.md:1155`). Need to append repository governance/initial commit policy to fully round out 1.3. |
| 2. Infrastructure & Deployment | ⚠️ Partial | CI/CD and IaC pipelines clearly defined (`docs/architecture.md:1234`). Missing explicit plan for initial database seeding/fixtures to support onboarding templates and quotas. |
| 3. External Dependencies & Integrations | ⚠️ Partial | Third-party provisioning playbooks are strong (`docs/prd.md:244`). Lacks DNS/domain ownership + SSL rollout steps and broader offline fallback guidance beyond Supabase staging keys. |
| 4. UI/UX Considerations | ✅ Pass | UX spec nails flows, accessibility, and asset workflow (`docs/front-end-spec.md:65`, `docs/front-end-spec.md:209`). |
| 5. User/Agent Responsibility | ✅ Pass | Responsibility matrix clearly separates human vs agent ownership (`docs/prd.md:251`). |
| 6. Feature Sequencing & Dependencies | ✅ Pass | Epics and shared packages sequence logically (`docs/prd.md:286`, `docs/architecture.md:1125`). |
| 8. MVP Scope Alignment | ✅ Pass | MVP boundaries and deferrals documented (`docs/prd.md:109`). |
| 9. Documentation & Handoff | ⚠️ Partial | Technical docs strong (`docs/architecture.md:1155`); need documented code-review knowledge sharing cadence. |
| 10. Post-MVP Considerations | ⚠️ Partial | Future phases outlined (`docs/prd.md:124`) but no explicit technical debt register or mitigation cadence. |

## Blockers & Risks
1. **Initial Data Seeding (High impact, Medium likelihood):** No scripts/playbook for populating starter strategies, quota baselines, or demo accounts. Risk: onboarding stalls on first deploy.
2. **DNS / SSL Provisioning (High impact, Medium likelihood):** Infrastructure docs omit domain registration, DNS, CNAME/ALB wiring, and certificate issuance. Risk: public launch + auth callbacks blocked.
3. **Third-Party Credential Fallbacks (Medium impact, Medium likelihood):** Supabase guidance exists, but Kaiko/Stripe fallback paths and mocks not documented. Risk: engineers blocked waiting on approvals.
4. **Code Review Knowledge Transfer (Medium impact, Medium likelihood):** No explicit checklist or async share-out process; threatens consistency during build. 
5. **Technical Debt Register (Medium impact, Medium likelihood):** Post-MVP roadmap lacks debt tracking, risking unmanaged backlog as features ship.

## Recommendations
1. **Author Seeding & Backfill Plan:** Define scripts + owners for populating core reference data before Epic 1 closes.
2. **Document DNS/SSL Playbook:** Capture domain acquisition, DNS records, and certificate automation in infrastructure section with clear ownership.
3. **Expand Third-Party Fallback Guidance:** Document sandbox credentials, mock services, and escalation paths for Kaiko, Stripe, Supabase, etc.
4. **Establish Code Review Cadence:** Introduce review checklist + knowledge-sharing workflow (recorded walkthroughs or annotated PR templates) within handoff docs.
5. **Start Technical Debt Register:** Maintain lightweight debt log linked to roadmap to monitor mitigation commitments post-MVP.

## Supporting Evidence
- Project type and monorepo scope: `docs/architecture.md:8`, `docs/prd.md:182`
- Bootstrap & tooling guidance: `docs/prd.md:200`, `docs/architecture.md:1155`
- CI/CD & environment setup: `docs/architecture.md:1234`
- Third-party provisioning playbooks: `docs/prd.md:244`
- UX flows & accessibility: `docs/front-end-spec.md:65`, `docs/front-end-spec.md:209`
- Responsibility matrix: `docs/prd.md:251`
- MVP boundaries: `docs/prd.md:109`
- Future phases and debt gap: `docs/prd.md:124`

## Next Actions
1. Assign owners + due dates for the five recommendations; update PRD/architecture appendices once complete.
2. Re-run PO checklist after blockers addressed to flip outstanding items to ✅.
3. Brief engineering/DevOps leads on DNS and seeding gaps before Sprint 1 kickoff.
