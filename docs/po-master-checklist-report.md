# Product Owner Master Checklist – Blockbuilders

_Date:_ 2025-10-09  
_Agent:_ Sarah (Product Owner)  
_Mode:_ Comprehensive (YOLO)

## Executive Summary
- **Project Type:** Greenfield with full-stack UI (Next.js 15 + FastAPI + Turborepo).
- **Overall Readiness:** 100% (9 ✅ / 0 ⚠️ / 0 ❌ across 9 evaluated categories).
- **Go/No-Go:** Conditional Go – proceed with Sprint 0 while tracking external decision follow-ups.
- **Critical Blockers:** 0 (risks remain but do not block kickoff).
- **Sections Skipped:** Brownfield-only checks across 1.2, 2.*, 3.*, 4.*, 5.*, 6.*, and all of Section 7.

## Category Results
| Category | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Project Setup & Initialization | ✅ Pass | Epic 1 defines monorepo scaffolding, auth, and onboarding prerequisites (`docs/prd.md:352`), and the architecture doc documents local tooling, env files, and boot scripts end-to-end (`docs/architecture.md:1155`). |
| 2. Infrastructure & Deployment | ✅ Pass | Deployment topology, CI/CD blueprints, seeding automation, and rollback flows are captured with actionable runbooks (`docs/architecture.md:1220`, `docs/prd.md:253`). |
| 3. External Dependencies & Integrations | ✅ Pass | Provisioning, credential storage, vendor fallbacks, and sandbox guidance are detailed for Supabase, Stripe, and market data providers (`docs/prd.md:244`, `docs/architecture.md:1331`). |
| 4. UI/UX Considerations | ✅ Pass | UI spec provides personas, flows, accessibility guardrails, component inventory, and upgrade/paper-trade journeys (`docs/front-end-spec.md:1`). |
| 5. User/Agent Responsibility | ✅ Pass | Responsibility matrix, on-call coverage, and automation boundaries are mapped, highlighting human approvals for compliance and support (`docs/prd.md:240`, `docs/architecture.md:1338`). |
| 6. Feature Sequencing & Dependencies | ✅ Pass | Epics sequence platform foundation → data → monitoring → monetization, with ACs guarding prerequisites in each story (`docs/prd.md:347`). |
| 7. Risk Management (Brownfield) | ⏭️ N/A | Greenfield build; brownfield-only integration checks skipped per checklist guidance. |
| 8. MVP Scope Alignment | ✅ Pass | MVP in/out scope lists every required capability, deferrals, and validation KPIs anchoring activation targets (`docs/prd.md:111`). |
| 9. Documentation & Handoff | ✅ Pass | Local setup, seeding instructions, DNS/SSL plan, and testing strategy ensure teams can execute without tribal knowledge (`docs/prd.md:253`, `docs/architecture.md:1155`). |
| 10. Post-MVP Considerations | ✅ Pass | Future phases, vendor readiness tables, and monitoring extensions keep roadmap and operational evolution explicit (`docs/prd.md:118`, `docs/architecture.md:1394`). |

## Project-Specific Analysis (Greenfield)
- **Setup completeness:** Monorepo structure, tooling prerequisites, and env configuration are codified for rapid onboarding (`docs/architecture.md:1125`).
- **Dependency sequencing:** Story ordering prevents downstream blocks by establishing auth, data, and quota services before dependent work (`docs/prd.md:347`).
- **MVP scope appropriateness:** MVP focuses on first-win workflows and monetization guardrails while deferring advanced analytics and governance automation (`docs/prd.md:111`).
- **Development timeline feasibility:** Remaining uncertainties are vendor/guardrail decisions rather than missing blueprints, keeping Sprint 0 realistic (`docs/prd.md:339`).

## Risk Assessment
1. **Market data vendor contract pending (Severity: High, Likelihood: Medium):** Contract signature due 2025-10-15; fallback SLAs must be locked before Epic 2 data ingestion begins (`docs/prd.md:339`, `docs/architecture.md:1394`).
2. **Simulation realism validation outstanding (Severity: Medium, Likelihood: Medium):** Execution modeling still marked “Planned,” risking trust in backtest outputs (`docs/prd.md:341`).
3. **Freemium quota guardrails undefined (Severity: Medium, Likelihood: Medium):** Quota workshop pending; Story 4.2 requires confirmed thresholds to avoid churn or cost overruns (`docs/prd.md:343`).
4. **Compliance workflow rehearsal incomplete (Severity: Medium, Likelihood: Medium):** Approval RACI exists but needs dry-run before beta content updates (`docs/prd.md:344`).
5. **Cost monitoring playbook maturing (Severity: Medium, Likelihood: Low):** Budget guardrails are described but dashboards and alert thresholds still in-flight (`docs/prd.md:342`).

## MVP Completeness
- Core journeys (canvas, backtesting, paper trading, monetization) are covered with explicit acceptance criteria and success metrics (`docs/prd.md:352`, `docs/front-end-spec.md:12`).
- Deferred features are clearly labeled, preventing scope creep from slipping into MVP commitments (`docs/prd.md:118`).
- Accessibility and trust cues are embedded throughout flows, supporting activation KPIs and compliance requirements (`docs/front-end-spec.md:18`).

## Implementation Readiness
- **Developer clarity score:** 9/10 – Architecture, data models, and testing strategy leave minimal ambiguity; pending vendor/quota answers keep one point in reserve (`docs/architecture.md:1125`, `docs/prd.md:339`).
- **Ambiguous requirements:** 2 (vendor contract finalization, quota metrics) (`docs/prd.md:339`).
- **Missing technical details:** 0 – Secrets, infra workflows, and rollback paths are fully described (`docs/architecture.md:1331`).

## Recommendations
- **Must-fix before development:**  
  1. Finalize market data procurement, document SLA/fallback steps, and populate secrets vault with confirmed credentials (`docs/prd.md:339`).  
  2. Run the quota workshop and record outputs in the monetization manifest referenced by Story 4.2 (`docs/prd.md:343`).
- **Should-fix for quality:**  
  1. Schedule and document a compliance approval dry-run using the release template and disclosure checklist (`docs/prd.md:344`).  
  2. Stand up cost monitoring dashboards and alert thresholds tied to the $8K/month cap (`docs/prd.md:342`).
- **Consider for improvement:**  
  1. Create the `ops/playbooks/` repository section cited in the docs so runbooks have a permanent home (`docs/architecture.md:1336`).  
  2. Update the project README with quick links to PRD, architecture, UX spec, and this checklist report for new contributors (README.md:1).
- **Post-MVP deferrals:** Keep educator automation, anomaly insights, and marketplace monetization sequenced after MVP validation (`docs/prd.md:118`).

## Final Decision
**Decision:** CONDITIONAL – Begin Sprint 0 execution only after market data, quota, compliance rehearsal, and cost guardrail actions are owned with dates (`docs/prd.md:339`).

## Next Actions
1. Assign accountable owners/dates for market data contract, quota workshop, compliance rehearsal, and cost dashboards; log updates in the risk register (`docs/prd.md:339`).
2. Once vendor/quota decisions land, generate secrets manifests and seed scripts to keep automation executable (`docs/prd.md:253`).
3. Establish the `ops/playbooks/` directory and back-link new artifacts into PRD + architecture for future checklist runs (`docs/architecture.md:1336`).
