# Product Owner Master Checklist – Blockbuilders

_Date:_ 2025-10-09
_Agent:_ Sarah (Product Owner)
_Mode:_ Comprehensive (full checklist)

## Executive Summary
- **Project Type:** Greenfield with full-stack UI (Next.js 15 + FastAPI + Turborepo).
- **Overall Readiness:** 100% (9 ✅ / 0 ⚠️ / 0 ❌ across 9 evaluated categories).
- **Go/No-Go:** Conditional Go – start Sprint 0 execution while tracking vendor, quota, and compliance decisions as exit criteria.
- **Critical Blockers:** 0 (open risks require follow-up but do not block kick-off).
- **Sections Skipped:** Brownfield-only checks in 1.2, 2.*, 3.*, 4.* brownfield lines, 5.* brownfield lines, 6.* brownfield lines, and entire Section 7.

## Category Results
| Category | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. Project Setup & Initialization | ✅ Pass | Epic 1 and architecture detail scaffolding, local setup, and env configuration for the monorepo (`docs/prd.md:356-388`, `docs/architecture.md:1156-1190`). |
| 2. Infrastructure & Deployment | ✅ Pass | CI/CD, IaC flow, and seeding/DNS runbooks are sequenced with rollback coverage and environment matrix (`docs/architecture.md:1240-1334`, `docs/prd.md:253-268`). |
| 3. External Dependencies & Integrations | ✅ Pass | Third-party provisioning, credential storage, and sandbox workflows defined with fallback guidance (`docs/prd.md:244-265`, `docs/architecture.md:1323-1336`). |
| 4. UI/UX Considerations | ✅ Pass | UX spec covers personas, flows, accessibility, and component inventory with success metrics (`docs/front-end-spec.md:1-180`). |
| 5. User/Agent Responsibility | ✅ Pass | Responsibility matrix, runbooks, and knowledge-transfer plans delineate human vs. automation ownership (`docs/prd.md:285-305`). |
| 6. Feature Sequencing & Dependencies | ✅ Pass | Epics/stories sequence foundation → data → monitoring → monetization with explicit prerequisites (`docs/prd.md:347-432`). |
| 7. Risk Management (Brownfield) | ⏭️ N/A | Greenfield build; brownfield-only assessments skipped per checklist rules. |
| 8. MVP Scope Alignment | ✅ Pass | MVP in/out scope, deferrals, and validation KPIs tightened around activation metrics (`docs/prd.md:109-137`). |
| 9. Documentation & Handoff | ✅ Pass | Setup instructions, API docs, testing strategy, and comms templates enable smooth handoff (`docs/architecture.md:1125-1190`, `docs/prd.md:300-337`). |
| 10. Post-MVP Considerations | ✅ Pass | Roadmap captures future phases, extensibility, analytics, and monitoring plans (`docs/prd.md:124-137`, `docs/architecture.md:1397-1410`). |

## Project-Specific Analysis (Greenfield)
- **Setup completeness:** Monorepo blueprint, local tooling, and env patterns are fully specified (`docs/architecture.md:1156-1190`).
- **Dependency sequencing:** Stories layer auth, data, simulation, and monetization in execution order, avoiding cross-epic deadlocks (`docs/prd.md:347-432`).
- **MVP scope appropriateness:** MVP boundaries and deferrals keep beta focused on first-win value and controlled governance (`docs/prd.md:109-127`).
- **Development timeline feasibility:** Remaining work involves decisions rather than missing blueprints; schedule stays realistic once risks are cleared (`docs/prd.md:339-344`).

## Risk Assessment
1. **Market data vendor contract pending (Severity: High, Likelihood: Medium):** Kaiko contract still unsigned; fallback vendor not locked, threatening Epic 2 schedule (`docs/prd.md:339-343`, `docs/architecture.md:1397-1408`).
2. **Simulation realism validation outstanding (Severity: Medium, Likelihood: Medium):** Execution modeling plan is still “Planned,” risking trust in paper-trade results if delayed (`docs/prd.md:341-342`).
3. **Freemium quota guardrails undefined (Severity: Medium, Likelihood: Medium):** Guardrail workshop pending; without decisions Story 4.2 risks churn or budget overruns (`docs/prd.md:343`).
4. **Compliance review workflow untested (Severity: Medium, Likelihood: Medium):** Approval RACI and rehearsal due Sprint 1; delay could block releases (`docs/prd.md:344`).
5. **Infrastructure cost monitoring playbook incomplete (Severity: Medium, Likelihood: Low):** Cost guardrail modeling ongoing; needs dashboards and throttling thresholds to avoid budget breaches (`docs/prd.md:342`).

## MVP Completeness
- Core user journeys (canvas, backtest, paper trading, monetization) all traced to MVP must-haves (`docs/prd.md:109-146`).
- No essential feature gaps remain; deferred items are documented in Phase 2/3 roadmaps (`docs/prd.md:118-127`).
- UX metrics and accessibility requirements align with success measures for activation and trust (`docs/front-end-spec.md:12-24`, `docs/prd.md:129-137`).

## Implementation Readiness
- **Developer clarity score:** 9/10 – Architecture, testing strategy, and API contracts remove ambiguity; pending external decisions keep one point in reserve (`docs/architecture.md:1125-1560`, `docs/prd.md:339-344`).
- **Ambiguous requirements:** 2 (market data vendor decision, freemium quota thresholds) (`docs/prd.md:339-343`).
- **Missing technical details:** 0 – Data models, env vars, and pipelines are fully described (`docs/architecture.md:1125-1334`).

## Recommendations
- **Must-fix before development:**
  1. Finalize Kaiko vs. Coin Metrics contract, document fallback SLA, and record keys/runbooks before Epic 2 start (`docs/prd.md:339-343`).
  2. Hold Sprint 0 quota workshop to lock guardrail metrics and update manifests for Story 4.2 (`docs/prd.md:343`).
- **Should-fix for quality:**
  1. Complete compliance approval RACI and rehearse the workflow with release template updates (`docs/prd.md:344`).
  2. Publish cost monitoring dashboards and throttle triggers tied to the $8K budget cap (`docs/prd.md:342`).
- **Consider for improvement:**
  1. Stand up the `ops/playbooks/` directory referenced in docs so inline procedures have a durable home (`docs/prd.md:251`, `docs/architecture.md:1336`).
  2. Expand `README.md` with links to PRD, architecture, and setup checklists to streamline onboarding (`README.md:1`).
- **Post-MVP deferrals:** Keep educator automation, advanced analytics, and marketplace monetization out of MVP until activation metrics stabilize (`docs/prd.md:118-127`).

## Final Decision
**Decision:** CONDITIONAL – begin Sprint 0 execution while tracking vendor, quota, compliance, and cost guardrail actions as exit criteria.

## Next Actions
1. Assign owners/dates for market data contract, quota workshop, compliance rehearsal, and cost dashboards; capture outcomes in the risk register (`docs/prd.md:339-344`).
2. Create seed manifests / secrets stubs once vendor + quota decisions land so seeding automation stays executable (`docs/architecture.md:1290-1308`).
3. Establish `ops/playbooks/` repo section and link new artifacts back into PRD/architecture for future checklist runs (`docs/architecture.md:1336`).
